The Growth Incident occured on January 7th, 2021 [[Terms/Pre-Labyrinthian Era\|PL.]], when humanity's dream of reaching Mars had finally come true with the start of the [[Events/Legacy-1\|Legacy-1]] mission, that launched on October 16th, 2019 PL. A crew of six seasoned astronauts embarked on a journey that would define a generation. As they traversed the void, they were filled with hope, envisioning groundbreaking discoveries awaiting them on the red planet.

Upon their return to Earth, however, the atmosphere was somber. The spacecraft landed with a heavy thud, and as the hatch opened, the world watched in horror. The astronauts emerged lifeless, their bodies showing no signs of trauma, yet their faces bore expressions of unspeakable terror. Accompanying them was an artifact—a shimmering, enigmatic [[Relics/The Cube\|cube]] that pulsed with an otherworldly light. Scientists and government officials quickly gathered, eager to uncover the secrets of the Cube.

As they cautiously pried it open, a deep rumble echoed through the ground, and the air crackled with energy. Without warning, colossal [[Terms/Walls\|walls]] began to rise, emerging directly from the Cube itself. Made of an unknown material that shimmered and twisted, these walls expanded rapidly, covering vast regions, cities, and entire countries. 

In just seven days, the Labyrinthum had claimed 70% of the Earth's population, leaving the survivors in shock and disbelief. Those who survived found themselves living within the structure of the Labyrinthum. As they adapted to their new reality, individuals began to notice [[Terms/Labyrinthian Legacy\|peculiar abilities]] awakening within them. Many discovered that their grief and fear ignited latent powers. A sense of awe mixed with terror as they realized they could manipulate elements, heal wounds, or summon light. 

This marked the dawn of the Years of Early Mages. The survivors, now imbued with magical abilities, formed small enclaves within the Labyrinthum, where they shared knowledge and honed their newfound powers. The world, once dominated by technology and science, began to shift toward an age where magic reigned. It was later revealed that the reason for the awakening of magical abilities in people was the formation of an [[Terms/Heart Engine\|unknown implant]] on the heart.

Yet, the Labyrinthum loomed as both a refuge and a mystery. Its walls twisted and shifted, creating a complex labyrinth of territories. Many sought to explore its depths, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to understand the true nature of the new world. As they ventured into the maze-like structure, they faced challenges that tested their abilities and their resolve. 

The environment was unforgiving, requiring them to learn quickly how to harness their powers effectively. The ruins of the previous civilization scattered throughout the Labyrinthum served as reminders of what had been lost, but the true purpose of this extraterrestrial structure remained a mystery. 

The survivors learned to navigate their new world, developing their skills and discovering a sense of community and purpose. In the wake of tragedy, they found hope. The Years of Early Mages had begun, marked by resilience, discovery, and an unwavering commitment to forge a brighter future from the ashes of despair. 

As humanity adapted to their new world, [[Locations/Grangaya\|Grangaya]] became both a symbol of their loss and a beacon of their potential, shaping the course of history for generations to come. The remnants of humanity thrived within its walls, realizing that their greatest strength lay not just in their magic but in their unity and shared purpose.
