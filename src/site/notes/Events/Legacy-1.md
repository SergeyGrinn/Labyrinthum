**Legacy-1** was a groundbreaking crewed extraterrestrial mission launched on October 16, 2019, aimed at exploring the Martian surface and conducting comprehensive scientific investigations. This mission represented a significant advancement in human space exploration, with objectives focused on expanding humanity's extraterrestrial presence and obtaining vital data about Mars' geology and atmosphere.

#### Mission Overview

- **Launch Date:** October 16, 2019
- **Duration:** 449 days
- **Operator:** [NASA]
- **Crew:** Six astronauts, selected for their diverse expertise in astrobiology, planetary geology, aerospace engineering, and environmental science.

#### Objectives

The Legacy-1 mission sought to:

- Conduct in-situ analyses of Martian soil and rock samples to assess mineralogical composition and potential biosignatures.
- Implement advanced life support systems to evaluate long-term habitability and resource utilization.
- Gather telemetry data to evaluate Mars' climatic conditions and atmospheric composition for future human colonization efforts.

#### Tragic Return

Upon their return to Earth, the Legacy-1 crew encountered a catastrophic and enigmatic fate. The spacecraft experienced an uncontrolled descent and crashed in New Zealand on January 7, 2021, at a designated recovery zone. As the hatch opened, the world watched with bated breath, but horror ensued when the astronauts emerged in a state of pronounced lifelessness.

Emergency medical personnel and scientists swiftly arrived to provide assistance, but it became evident that the astronauts had succumbed to an unknown phenomenon. Their bodies exhibited no visible trauma, yet their facial expressions indicated profound psychological distress, suggesting acute stress reactions or other unexplained physiological anomalies.

The circumstances surrounding their demise precipitated an immediate global investigation involving multidisciplinary teams of scientists, government officials, and military personnel. Speculations arose regarding potential etiological factors, including exposure to uncharacterized Martian pathogens, psychological effects stemming from isolation and environmental stressors, or the influence of the Cube that accompanied them. As investigations progressed, debates intensified regarding the nature of their experiences on Mars and the implications for future missions.

#### The Cube

Accompanying the astronauts was a cryptic artifact known as the Cube. This anomalous object, retrieved from the Martian surface during their exploration, exhibited peculiar energetic properties and appeared to resonate with an unknown frequency. Following the crew's tragic return, scientists commenced extensive analyses of the Cube, hypothesizing that it might hold critical insights into the events leading to the crew's demise.

Upon its activation, the Cube instigated a catastrophic event, resulting in the emergence of the Labyrinthum, a colossal extraterrestrial structure that began to ascend from the Earth’s crust. The Labyrinthum expanded rapidly, enveloping vast terrestrial regions and precipitating the loss of approximately 70% of the Earth's population within a mere seven days. This event soon became known as "[[Events/The Growth Incident\|The Growth Incident]]".

#### Aftermath and Legacy

In the wake of the events catalyzed by the Cube, Earth was reclassified as Grangaya (Γρανγαῖα), symbolizing both a geographical and metaphysical transformation. Survivors within the Labyrinthum began to manifest latent magical abilities, thought to be awakened by their exposure to the structure, marking the advent of the Era of Early Mages.

The Legacy-1 mission, despite its tragic outcomes, is recognized as a pivotal chapter in the annals of human exploration, underscoring the profound impact of extraterrestrial encounters on civilization and heralding a new epoch defined by the intersection of magic, science, and the unknown.
