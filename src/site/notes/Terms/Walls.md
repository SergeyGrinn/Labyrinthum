The **Walls** of the Labyrinthum are an extensive network of green, indestructible structures that emerged on Earth following the "Growth Incident" on January 7, 2021. Covering approximately 80% of the planet's surface, these walls have dramatically altered Earth's geography, ecology, and human civilization by assembling in a random arrangement that creates distinct "levels," rendering previous state borders obsolete.

## Discovery and Emergence

The origin of the Labyrinthum walls is traced back to the piloted space mission **Legacy-1**, a venture to Mars undertaken by humanity in late 2020. Upon the mission's return, the crew was found deceased under mysterious circumstances. Among the recovered items was a cube of unknown origin and composition.

When scientists attempted to open the cube for examination, it reacted violently upon contact with Earth's oxygen. Green walls began to sprout from the cube, growing at an exponential rate. Over seven days, these walls expanded uncontrollably, engulfing vast expanses of land and reshaping Earth's surface. This rapid and destructive event was later termed the **Growth Incident**.

## Composition and Structure

### Physical Properties

The walls are composed of an unknown material exhibiting properties that defy current scientific understanding:

- **Impenetrability**: The walls are completely impenetrable. Attempts to cut, break, or chemically alter them have been unsuccessful. The only known forces capable of interacting with the walls are historical timeless relics and the Emperor's Labyrinthian magic.
- **Transparency Variance**: From a distance, the walls appear transparent, but as one approaches, they become semitransparent due to the influence of the Labyrinthum's magical properties.
- **Light Interaction**: While the walls do not block sunlight, they partially refract it, creating unique lighting conditions within the labyrinth.
- **Silhouettes**: Eerily, silhouettes of those who were caught in the path of the growing walls can sometimes be seen embedded within them.

### Growth Patterns

The walls assembled in a random order, creating distinct sections known as **levels**:

- **Levels Formation**: The random arrangement resulted in numerous enclosed areas or levels, each isolated from the others by the impenetrable walls.
- **Elimination of State Borders**: The formation of levels disrupted existing geopolitical boundaries, making traditional state borders irrelevant.
- **Division into Regions**: In response, humanity restructured global governance, dividing the world into **seven regions** to better manage resources and coordinate survival efforts. One of these regions is notable for containing no solid surfaces like land or islands, presenting unique challenges.

### Magical Properties

- **Ecosystem Manipulation**: The walls have a magical effect on the ecosystems within each level, causing drastic environmental differences between neighboring levels. For example, a dry, desert level might border a humid forest.
- **Silhouettes of the Lost**: The presence of silhouettes within the walls suggests a mystical or supernatural aspect to their composition, possibly tied to the fate of those caught during the Growth Incident.

## Environmental Impact

### Ecological Effects

The sudden emergence of the walls led to significant ecological disturbances:

- **Habitat Fragmentation**: The creation of levels isolated ecosystems, leading to unique evolutionary paths and biodiversity within each level.
- **Microclimates**: Due to the walls' influence on sunlight and atmospheric conditions, each level developed its own microclimate.
- **Ecosystem Manipulation**: The magical properties of the walls altered the natural environment within levels, sometimes creating biomes that would not naturally occur in those locations.

### Atmospheric Influence

- **Weather Patterns**: The walls' arrangement affects local and regional weather patterns, with the refracted sunlight contributing to unusual climatic conditions.
- **Light Refraction**: The partial refraction of sunlight by the walls results in unique visual phenomena and affects photosynthesis processes in plants.

## Human Interaction

### Survivors and Adaptation

Human populations trapped within the labyrinth faced unprecedented challenges:

- **Resource Scarcity**: Isolation within levels led to shortages of food, water, and medical supplies, necessitating new methods of production and distribution.
- **Communication Barriers**: The impenetrable walls and magical interference hindered communication between levels and regions.
- **Silhouettes as Warnings**: The presence of silhouettes served as grim reminders of the walls' dangers, influencing cultural practices and cautionary tales.

### Division into Seven Regions

With traditional state borders eliminated, humanity reorganized into seven regions for governance and cooperation:

- **Regional Governance**: Each region developed its own administrative structures to manage resources and coordinate survival strategies.
- **The Uninhabitable Region**: One region, devoid of solid surfaces like land or islands, posed unique challenges and became a focus for technological and magical innovation to enable habitation.

### Labyrinthian Legacy

An unexpected consequence of the Growth Incident was the emergence of supernatural abilities among survivors, collectively known as the **Labyrinthian Legacy**:

- **Manifestation**: Abilities began appearing days to weeks after the Growth Incident, varying widely among individuals.
- **Emperor's Magic**: The Emperor, a figure who emerged with exceptional Labyrinthian abilities, could interact with the walls using magic, providing the only known means aside from historical timeless relics to manipulate them.
- **Types of Abilities**: Documented powers include manipulation of the labyrinth walls, environmental control within levels, and communication across walls.

## Theoretical Explanations

### Extraterrestrial Origin

Given the cube's origin from Mars and its role in the Growth Incident, theories suggest an extraterrestrial source:

- **Alien Technology**: The walls may be a form of alien technology designed for unknown purposes, possibly terraforming or containment.
- **Dimensional Bridging**: Some hypothesize that the walls bridge dimensions, explaining their magical properties and effects on ecosystems.

### Magical and Mystical Theories

The magical properties of the walls and the emergence of the Labyrinthian Legacy have led to mystical explanations:

- **Ancient Relics**: The effectiveness of historical timeless relics against the walls suggests a connection to ancient magic or forgotten civilizations.
- **Sentient Structure**: The walls might possess a form of consciousness or purpose beyond human understanding.

## Challenges and Ongoing Research

### Material Analysis

Efforts to understand the walls' composition continue:

- **Magical Properties**: Researchers study the walls' magical attributes, attempting to harness or counteract them.
- **Relic Integration**: Investigations into historical timeless relics aim to uncover why they can interact with the walls.

### Navigation and Mapping

Mapping the labyrinth is critical for survival:

- **Technological Solutions**: Devices that can detect the semitransparent walls from a distance are being developed.
- **Magical Navigation**: Individuals with navigation-related Labyrinthian abilities assist in exploring and connecting levels.

### Environmental Studies

Understanding the walls' impact on ecosystems is vital:

- **Microclimate Research**: Studies focus on how the walls create and maintain distinct microclimates.
- **Ecosystem Management**: Efforts are made to manage resources sustainably within isolated levels.

## Conclusion

The Walls of the Labyrinthum remain one of the most profound and enigmatic phenomena faced by humanity. Their random assembly into levels, impenetrable nature, and magical properties have redefined human society and the natural world. The reorganization into seven regions reflects humanity's resilience and adaptability in the face of unprecedented challenges. As research continues, the hope persists that unraveling the secrets of the labyrinth will lead to restoring balance to the planet and uncovering the truths behind this extraordinary event.
