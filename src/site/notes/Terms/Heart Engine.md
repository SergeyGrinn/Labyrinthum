**Heart Engine** (sometimes is a mystical implant that inexplicably manifested on the hearts of all survivors of the First Growth, the catastrophic event that followed the emergence of the Labyrinthum. This implant became the source of humanity’s newfound magical abilities, collectively known as the [[Terms/Labyrinthian Legacy\|Labyrinthian Legacy]].

### Structure and Function

The Heart Engine functions as both a biological and metaphysical organ, attached to the human heart. It produces a unique substance that flows through the bloodstream, enabling the development and use of magical abilities in those who possess it. This substance acts as a conduit, channeling the power derived from the Labyrinthum itself.

### Evolution

Over time, the Heart Engine evolved within its hosts, gradually replacing the heart entirely. This transformation significantly enhanced the magical abilities of humans, allowing for more powerful and sophisticated manifestations of the Labyrinthian Legacy. As the engine took over the heart’s functions, it optimized the body’s capacity for magical use, resulting in a deeper connection to the Labyrinthum’s energies.

### "Withering Shock"

A unique aspect of the Heart Engine is its influence on the death of those who possess it, manifesting in a phenomenon known as "withering shock." When a mage dies, their body enters a state of complete paralysis that lasts between **4 to 18 hours**. During this time, all magical energy within their system dissipates.

While paralyzed, mages are unable to move or feel pain, but they retain consciousness, being able to see, hear, and breathe. The majority of their bodily functions, except for the heart engine and a small portion of the brain, cease to operate. Only after the period of paralysis concludes does the mage finally succumb to death. This gradual process of magical energy dispersal and bodily shutdown adds a complex layer to the life and death cycle of those influenced by the Labyrinthian Legacy.
### Impact

The evolution of the Heart Engine marked a pivotal point in human development, as the complete integration of the engine allowed survivors to wield greater levels of magical power. This phenomenon has led to the creation of advanced magic users, shaping the cultural and societal dynamics of post-Labyrinthum civilization.
