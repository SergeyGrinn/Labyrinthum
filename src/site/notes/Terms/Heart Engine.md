# Heart Engine

The **Heart Engine** is a mystical organ integral to all inhabitants of the Labyrinthum, inherited at birth. It is the source of humanity's magical abilities, collectively known as the _Labyrinthian Legacy_. Over generations since the [[Events/The Growth Incident\|First Growth]], the Heart Engine has evolved, gradually replacing the original human heart and fundamentally altering human physiology and capabilities.

## Structure and Function

### Biological Integration

The Heart Engine is fully integrated into the physiology of every individual born within the Labyrinthum. Functioning seamlessly from birth, it replaces the original heart, taking over all circulatory duties. The Heart Engine enhances physical resilience, allowing individuals to endure greater physical stress and recover more rapidly from injuries. However, it does **not** extend the human lifespan.

The Heart Engine produces a unique, unidentified substance that circulates through the bloodstream. This substance acts as a conduit for magical energies, enabling individuals to develop and harness various magical abilities associated with the Labyrinthian Legacy.

### Biotechnological Functionality: Heart Code

Advancements in bioengineering have led to the development of the **Heart Code**, a modification of the Heart Engine that allows users to bind small equipment or specialized suits on command. This bioengineering intervention connects the Heart Code with the Heart Engine, enabling seamless integration of technology and magic.

- **Functionality**: The Heart Code interfaces with external devices or suits, allowing for instantaneous deployment and retraction controlled by the user's intent.
- **Bioengineering Process**: Implementing the Heart Code requires a medical procedure where bioengineers modify the Heart Engine to establish a connection with the desired equipment.
- **Contraindications**: Although the modification is widespread, it may be contraindicated for some individuals due to health issues or simple incompatibility. Factors such as underlying medical conditions, unique physiological traits, or immune system responses can prevent safe integration of the Heart Code.
- **Applications**: Common uses include protective armor, exploration tools within the Labyrinthum, and devices that enhance or focus the user's magical abilities.

## Evolutionary Process

### Generational Evolution

The Heart Engine has evolved through successive generations since the First Growth, gradually replacing the original human heart in the population of the Labyrinthum.

- **Inheritance**: All individuals born within the Labyrinthum possess the Heart Engine from birth.
- **Uniform Functionality**: Heart Engines are nearly identical in functionality across the population, resulting in no social division or differentiation based on its capabilities.
- **Physical Enhancement**: The evolution of the Heart Engine has led to a baseline enhancement in physical resilience for all inhabitants.

### Enhancement of Abilities

While the Heart Engine provides a foundation for magical abilities, individual proficiency and specialization in the Labyrinthian Legacy are influenced by factors such as training, experience, and personal aptitude rather than differences in the Heart Engine itself.

## Withering Shock

A unique phenomenon associated with the Heart Engine is the **"Withering Shock"**, which occurs upon the death of an individual.

### Characteristics

- **Paralysis Duration**: The body enters a state of complete paralysis lasting between **4 to 18 hours**.
- **Consciousness Retention**: Despite paralysis, the individual remains conscious, able to see, hear, and breathe.
- **Cessation of Functions**: Most bodily functions cease, except for minimal brain activity and the operation of the Heart Engine.
- **Energy Dissipation**: Magical energy gradually dissipates from the body during paralysis.

### Mechanism

The Withering Shock allows for the controlled dispersal of residual magical energy, preventing potential surges or uncontrolled magical events that could occur from an abrupt release upon death. This process ensures a gradual shutdown of the Heart Engine and associated energies.

### Implications

- **Medical Considerations**: Challenges arise in providing care during the paralysis period, as the individual remains conscious but immobilized.
- **Cultural Practices**: Rituals and customs have developed to honor and comfort individuals during the Withering Shock, recognizing their awareness during this final period.

## Biotechnological Advancements

### Heart Code Development

The **Heart Code** represents a significant achievement in bioengineering, enhancing the practical application of magic in conjunction with technology.

- **Bioengineering Intervention**: The Heart Code requires a specialized procedure to modify the Heart Engine, establishing a direct link with specific equipment or suits.
- **Contraindications**: Despite its widespread use, the Heart Code modification may not be suitable for everyone. Health issues or simple incompatibility can contraindicate the procedure. Conditions such as heart anomalies, immune disorders, or unique physiological variations may pose risks.
- **Accessibility and Equity**: While the modification is broadly available, medical screenings are necessary to ensure candidate safety. Alternative solutions are sought for those unable to undergo the procedure to prevent societal disparities.
- **Equipment Binding**: Users can summon or retract bound equipment on command, enhancing versatility and efficiency in various tasks.
- **Applications**: The Heart Code is utilized in multiple fields, including defense, exploration, and industry, augmenting the capabilities of individuals in their respective roles.

## Impact on Society

### Cultural and Societal Dynamics

The universal presence and near-identical functionality of the Heart Engine have led to a society where magical abilities are a common aspect of daily life.

- **Equality in Magic**: Since all inhabitants possess the Heart Engine from birth and it functions similarly in everyone, there is no inherent social division based on its capabilities.
- **Education and Training**: Institutions focus on teaching individuals how to develop and control their magical abilities, emphasizing personal growth and responsibility.
- **Integration of Magic and Technology**: The development of the Heart Code showcases the blending of magical and technological advancements, enhancing capabilities across various professions.

### Addressing Contraindications

- **Support Systems**: For individuals unable to receive the Heart Code modification due to health issues or incompatibility, support systems and alternative technologies are provided to ensure inclusivity.
- **Medical Research**: Ongoing research aims to minimize contraindications and develop safer procedures, potentially increasing the number of individuals who can safely undergo the modification.
- **Non-Magical Innovations**: Technological advancements that do not rely on the Heart Code help bridge the gap, allowing all members of society to contribute meaningfully regardless of their ability to undergo the modification.

### Technological and Medical Advancements

- **Bioengineering Innovations**: The implementation of the Heart Code has propelled progress in bioengineering, emphasizing personalized medicine and safety.
- **Healthcare Improvements**: Enhanced understanding of the Heart Engine has led to better diagnostic tools and treatments, particularly in identifying and managing contraindications.

## Research and Theories

### Origins of the Heart Engine

Research into the origins of the Heart Engine focuses on its connection to the Labyrinthum and the events of the First Growth.

- **Labyrinthum Influence**: The pervasive energies of the Labyrinthum are believed to have initiated the evolutionary process that led to the Heart Engine becoming an inherited organ.
- **Genetic Adaptation**: Studies suggest that prolonged exposure to the Labyrinthum's environment prompted genetic adaptations passed down through generations.

### Scientific Studies

- **Physiological Effects**: Ongoing research examines how the Heart Engine interacts with human biology, including effects on metabolism, healing, and physical endurance.
- **Magical Mechanics**: Efforts are made to understand the mechanisms by which the Heart Engine facilitates magic, aiming to enhance training methods and safety protocols.

### Biotechnological Research

- **Heart Code Contraindications**: Research focuses on identifying the causes of incompatibility and developing methods to reduce risks, potentially allowing more individuals to safely undergo the modification.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensuring equitable access and addressing any potential risks associated with Heart Code modifications remain priorities.
